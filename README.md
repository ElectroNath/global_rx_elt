## Case Study & Hands-On Project for Global RX 

Global RX is a retail startup with no data warehouse but in Excel files.... Our task is to help them spin up a data warehouse that should be a free offering for a start. The solution should be something that can easily be automated to help the business easily gain insights into their best selling items, clients and locations. The Company needs a POC (Proof of Concept) in 2 days.

## Sample Data

A sample dataset in the file data/global-superstore-data.xlsx on the Orders sheet, has been provided to us to help the company achieve their goal.  Note that datasets can come in any form subsequently, but your logic should be easy to refactor. Sample Data
